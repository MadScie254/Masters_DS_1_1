    "## Basics of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a subset of machine learning, designed to recognize patterns. They are inspired by how the human brain works and consist of layers of interconnected nodes (also called neurons). These nodes process information in layers, learning from input data and adjusting based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks come in various architectures, each suited for specific tasks. The most common types include:\n",

    "- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**: Information flows in one direction from input to output.\n",
    "- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Designed to handle sequential data by incorporating feedback loops.\n",
    "- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Primarily used in image processing, utilizing convolutions to recognize patterns.\n",
    "- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**: Composed of two networks (generator and discriminator) that work against each other.\n",
